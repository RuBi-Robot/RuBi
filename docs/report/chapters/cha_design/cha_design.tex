\label{cha:design}

This section deals with the mechanical design of the robot.
Based on the analysis performed in the chapter \ref{cha:analysis}, the mechancal design takes its results and carries out a specific analysis of each component.
Then, the conclusions are translated into a 3D model making a compromise between the requirements and manufacturability.
