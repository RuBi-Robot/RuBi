\subsection{Impact force} % (fold)
\label{sub:impact_force}
In order to calculate the physical dimensions of some of the components, a bounding conditions have to be defined.
The presented case shows a peak of energy when landing after being jumped a estimated height.
This energy in then transmitted from the first contact point, the footprint, to the rest of the system, causing efforts that must be absorbed.
The components of the system must receive that energy under a controlled behavior -this is elastic deformations- assuring a longer life cycle of the legs.

Thus, some input parameters to calculate the impact force are assumed.
From this force will be sized all the consecutive components in the deformation chain.
Despite the deformation is of the whole system, the security coefficient assumed in here is going to be the calculation of all the components for that maximum force.

From the formula of the mechanical energy:
\begin{equation}
  E_{mechanical} = m g \Delta h + \frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
\end{equation}

The kinetic energy is negligible and only the energy form falling a certain height is supposed.
This energy is then translated into force by supposing a deformation of the whole body:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:impact_force}
  F_{impact} = \frac{m g \Delta h}{t_{impact\_displacement}}
\end{equation}

The equation \ref{eq:impact_force} gives the force for sizing all the components.
Based on the input parameters defined in the appendix \ref{app:profile_selection} which are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | c}
  Parameter & Value \\
  \hline
  Total mass [kg] & 1.5 \\
  Jumping height [m] & 0.1 \\
  Impact displacement [m] & 0.005
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The impact force is thus:
\begin{equation}
  F_{impact} = \frac{m g \Delta h}{t_{impact\_displacement}} = 294.40 N 
\end{equation}
