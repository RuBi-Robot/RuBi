\label{sub:motor_interaces}
Each BLDC motor in the Locokit comes with a motor board able to control it, designed for 24V and 48W.
They consist of a 48MHz ARM7 processor for time critical control and motor commutation, as stated in \cite{locokit-electronics}, together with 4 general purpose I/O inputs for local sensor interface.
They have two available 8-pin interfaces for the motors, a standard flex connector used in most of Maxon flat motors, and a standard Molex connector for general wiring.
