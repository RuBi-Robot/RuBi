In chapter \ref{cha:mathematical_model}, the necessary characteristics of the actuators have been calculated.
For the sake of feasibility it was decided to utilize electric motors for supplying the power to the robot, meaning that the right model had to be selected.
It can be demonstrated from \ref{} %cite actuators section here when finished 
that the requirements of the defined application for every joint in the robot can be accomplished by the BLDC motor + gearbox present in the Locokit robot construction kit, introduced in \cite{locokit}.
The flat motors model is 339260 from Maxon motor, whose datasheet can be found in \cite{maxon_motor}, and the planetary gearhead is the number 143976 in datasheet \cite{maxon_gear}.
The electromechanical constants of the motors, together with its nominal supply values or output power and torque of both the motor and the gearbox can be found in these documents. 
However, the electronics of the motors is designed to constantly overdrive them at $24V$, which has to be taken into account when calculating their output.
