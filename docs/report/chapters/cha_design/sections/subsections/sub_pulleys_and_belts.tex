\subsection{Pulleys and belts} % (fold)
\label{sub:pulleys_and_belts}
The section \ref{sec:joints} is dedicated to analyze and define what kind of motors and trasmission system is going to be used for each joint.
In the case of the knee and the ankle, the combination \textit{motor + gearbox + belt and pulleys} is chosen due to the preference of having the active actuator in the highest part of the link, reducing then the moment of inertia, with the withdrawal of having to transfer the movement the lowest.
This system has been designed along with the series torsional springs disussed in the section \ref{sub:compliance} where the rotation from the motor must feed the rotation of a series rotational spring.
A system in which pulley and spring holder are joined, have to be done then.
The design of the pulley itself though, has been studied in terms of two factors: \textit{precision and backlash reduction} and \textit{integration with the series rotational spring}.

\subsubsection{Precision and backlash reduction} % (fold)
\label{ssub:precision_and_backlash_reduction}
The goal of this design is to optimize the pulley in order to to get a lack of backlash, defined as the clearance between timing belt teeth and timing belt pulley grooves.
Despite the platform is going to be used mainly for self-learning controllers (e.g. based on neuronal networks) and then the mechanical optimization is not a priority, the reduction of mechanical uncertainty is always seek.

After analyze all the current solutions in the market, several non-backlash solutions are found.
Stands out the Gates GT3 Synchronous Belts\footnote{http://www.gates.com/products/industrial/industrial-belts/synchronous-belts/powergrip-gt3-belts} that is assured to be suitable for the presented application.
The withdrawals of this design are the lack of time for ordering such parts and the increase in the final price of the product. 
However there is another important factor: the integration that must be done with the series rotational spring.

\subsubsection{Integration with the series rotational spring} % (fold)
\label{ssub:integration_with_the_series_rotational}
Another solution is to design and manufacture the pulley itself which would let having a complete control of the design and manufacturability, giving then the possibility of integrate in a unique part design, the pulley for the transmission system and the spring holder.

At first, the GT3 design from Gates was intended to design.
However its design, that is described in U.S. Patent Number 4,515,577, doesn't allow its use.
Thus, the belts have been designed following the ISO 13050:2014 \cite{ISO13050} following the type T due to its focus in efficiency and reduction of backlash.
It is also appropriate for precision movements, high torques and low speeds, as our requirements.

The physical properties of the pulleys as the number of teeth, width, etc... have been chosen based on the ISO 5295:1987 \cite{ISO5295} and in sake of manufacturability.
As decided before, the pulley will belong to a part that will also have the task of holding the rotational series spring.
This implies that the part will be designed to be 3D printed and thus, the criteria of design oriented to manufacturability must be applied.

Based on both ISO norms cited before and after some iterations based on experimental tests, the pulley T2,5 of 19 teeth gave the expected behavior.
Both pulleys are the same so no reduction is given from the motor shaft to the other.
In the figure \ref{fig:motor_pulley}, a detail of the designed pulleys can be seen.

\subsubsection{Belts} % (fold)
\label{ssub:belts}
From \ref{ssub:integration_with_the_series_rotational} a system pulleys-belt using T2,5 teeth profile was selected.
For the design of the belt system, an open belt whose initial tension can be adjusted with a zip-tie is chosen.
This allows to adjust the tension in any moment without increasing the costs plus it facilitates the maintenance.
No initial tensioning of the belts studies were carried out and it is expected that the user finds out the correct value by experimenting.
