\chapter{Implementation} % (fold)
\label{cha:implementation}
The chapter \ref{cha:analysis} is meant for studying conceptual designs of the platform, and from the chapter \ref{cha:mathematical_model} some mathematical constraints are obtained, whilst the chapter \ref{cha:design} is where the robot is designed in its electronic, mechanical and control facets.
This chapter is dedicated to explain the process of creating those designs and create real working components.
From the important role of emerging low-cost technologies like FFF 3D printing up to the creation of custom PCBs for reducing the weight of the robot, the following sections are meant to explain the process of creation and acquisition (from the several providers) but following always a criteria of security, constrained budget and feasibility for maintenance and futures improvements.
