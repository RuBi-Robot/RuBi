\todo{I normally use this part of the chapter to justify its use in the report, not to present its structure.}
The implementation chapter starts with the 3D printing technology used for manufacture some of the parts of the robot. 
Other parts though, have been machined and that is dealt in the section \ref{sec:machining}.
It continues with the providers section \ref{sec:providers} where the discussion about where the the different parts have been got and the justification of its election.
Ends up with the assembly section \ref{sec:assembly} where the experiences when assembling the robot.
