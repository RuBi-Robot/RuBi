\label{sec:machining}
Along with 3D printing, other parts have needed to be machined.
As an example, the rods came in bars of one meter that have been cut and filed according the design.
Other example are the carbon fiber tubes.
These have been designed to carry the wiring inside them.
Thus some holes have been performed in the bottom and top part of the tube in order to insert them.
The drawings for such parts are included as appendices in \ref{app:mechanical_drawings}.
