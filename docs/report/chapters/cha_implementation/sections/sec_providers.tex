\section{Providers} % (fold)
\label{sec:providers}
In addition to the 3D printed and machined parts, other items have been bought from several providers.
The providers have been selected based on previous shoppings made by the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute.
All the needed items that could have followed an standard have been chosen. 
As an example, the robot only needs three types of screws (only M3 metric) and one kind of bearing.
The components are easily found and are not rare items or exotic materials that increase the price of the robot.
A list with all the components bought and its providers is attached as an appendix in \ref{app:order_list}.

As explained in the management of the project \ref{sec:project_management}, all the parts that are bought, included the springs, are ordered in the end of April. 
This was decided due to the delivery of the parts is a process that can take up to three weeks.
Despite all the parts where got within the first week, the springs have not been received, what has impeded the complete assembling of the robot.
However their fastening is easily made by following the assembly manuals provided and other experiments in which the springs are not needed will be carried out.
