\section{Biomechanics meets Control} % (fold)
\label{sec:biomechanics_vs_control}
The first attempts to accomplish artificial walking machines in the mid-1950s were based on stiff structures and kinematic control.
There has been more than 50 years of development in several technology fields between them and the current soft, compliant and torque-controlled legged robots.
Among the main advances that gave rise to the evolution of the autonomous walking robots, three considered essential and of great relevance for this thesis are listened in \ref{list:leg_advances} and further discussed here.

\begin{itemize}
\label{list:leg_advances}
	\item The realization of the importance that a dynamic and active control has on the walking behavior, as opposed to rigid, kinematics-based motion.
	\item The conception of the embodied AI
	\item The improvements in sensors/actuators performance, material science, computing power and power sources.
\end{itemize}

\label{sub:dynamics_control}
The first big steps taken in dynamic legged locomotion control took place in the Leg Laboratory, at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Marc Raibert and his team.
