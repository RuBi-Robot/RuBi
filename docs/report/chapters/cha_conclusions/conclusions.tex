\label{cha:conclusions}
As a general conclusion, 

% It should recall the issues raised in the introduction - what was the purpose of the piece of writing?

% and draw together the points made in the main body of the piece of writing

% and come to a clear conclusion.


%%% Mathematical model
% Development of an ground-contact force model --> the current one is a Normal function

%%% Mechanics
% Analyze all the mechanical stresses of individual parts and an assembly analysis
% Improve fastening for motor interfaces
% Improve foot shape in order to help the step
% Reinforce fragil sections in 3D printed parts
% Develop a method to tension the belts
% Reimplement parallel spring holder to make it easier
% Add more features to the structure
% Implement a jumping platform

%%% Electronics
% Alternatives to the use of the main board's input pins
% Implement a method to read easily from I/O
% Add more sensors to the robot: IMU
% Add absolute encoders or improve the initialization
% Reduce the network latency by using 5Ghz or by using ethernet
% Study the general latency of the system and how it affect to the measurements
% Develop a easier and safer system for powering the robot

%%% Simulation
% Add springs to the simulation
% Improve the simulation by modifying physic parameters until reach reailty-like results
% Add color and textures to the simulation
% Implement more experiments within the simulation
