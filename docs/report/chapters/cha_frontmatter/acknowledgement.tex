        The completion of a Master Thesis comprises an amount of work and effort difficult to assess since its extension is not bounded to a single semester of actual work, but it comprehends the process of acquisition of all the skills and knowledge applied on it.
        Thus, the task of properly acknowledging all those who somehow contributed to this moment turns out to be not trivial.\\ 
        We have tried our best here.
