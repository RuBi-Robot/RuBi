        \begin{abstract}
        The field of robotics, in its attempt to understand and mimic legged locomotion, has in the past decades given birth to some of the most advanced existing bipedal creatures, finding inspiration in nature and the human being.
        This thesis contributes the biped robot RuBi and its development environment to the advancement of this area of the engineering.
        RuBi is a human-inspired, compliance-reconfigurable and low-cost bipedal platform for research in human-like walking and running gaits control.
        The framework presented consists of the robot lower-body frame and control architecture, a simulation model and environment and a test bench for 2D motion.
        The interface with the robot has been created on ROS and the simulation environment in Gazebo, having been both successfully tested, and a set of experiments for the robot prototype are presented here.
        However, they have not been conducted due to time constraints and eventualities.
        Everything has been set so that the utilization of the framework can be easily learned and mastered by new users.
