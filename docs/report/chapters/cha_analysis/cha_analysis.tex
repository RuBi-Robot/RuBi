\label{cha:analysis}
The process of designing and constructing a bipedal robot as the presented here is a task of great magnitude in which a big set of parameters has to be analyzed and determined aiming at the most optimal solution possible. \footnote{Optimality here is measured in terms of the aimed goals, described in \ref{sec:goals}.}
Thus, the sections in this chapter contain the conceptual analyses conducted as the initial step in the conception of the RuBi prototype, together with a summary presentation of the research done in human locomotion 
Its results will be used as guidelines for the posterior and more detailed studies carried out during the implementation of the robot.
