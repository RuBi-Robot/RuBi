\section{Geometrical dimensions of the frame} % (fold)
\label{sec:dimensions}

The selection of the final dimensions of RuBi corresponds to an iterative process in which power requirements have been the first constraint when assessing the size of the robot.
A first approach was taken from \cite{grimmer}, Manuscript I, where normalized values of power required per joint and per kilogram of weigh of the structure can be found.
The first iteration targeted a robot of dimensions $m = 1Kg$ and length from the hip joint to the toes of $L = 0.6 m$.
The final parameters from the last iteration can be found in %***chapter Results

Once estimated an overall height of the structure, the dimensions of each link were decided to be obtained from the German table of the ISO 7250-2 \cite{iso_measurements} and the DIN 33402-2 \cite{din_measurements1} norms, following the idea of mimicking human-like motion as closely as possible.
These two norms are standard references in industry and were considered a general enough source of information.
Figure \ref{fig:human_measurements} depicts the human dimensions extracted from the norms and applied to the design of RuBi.

The crotch height, denoted as $B$ in the figure, has been matched to the distance from the hip joint to the heel bottom in the robot
