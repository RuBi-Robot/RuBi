\section{Geometrical dimensions of the frame} % (fold)
\label{sec:dimensions}

The selection of the final dimensions of RuBi corresponds to an iterative process in which power requirements have been the first constraint when assessing the size of the robot.



%% Here we just describe the process followed to obtain the final dimensions. 
%% The final results are shown in Chapter Results --> add tables and Froude number calculus
