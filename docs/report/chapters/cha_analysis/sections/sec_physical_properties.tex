\section{Inertial dimensions of the frame} % (fold)
\label{sec:physical_properties}
The determination of the geometrical dimensions for a robot model is in general a deterministic task in which all the parameters can be selected without dependencies or limitations.
However the inertial parameters of a robot will be the result of the selection of these dimensions, together with the materials utilized for the implementation and the configuration of the elements on the structure, among others.
Here, the goal of the adjustment of the final inertial parameters is not to mimic the dynamics of human legs as with the kinematics, but to reduce the power requirements for locomotion while ensuring robustness and reliability.
This section presents the theoretical guidelines followed during the design of RuBi regarding its dynamics.
The calculations carried out are to be found in chapters \ref{cha:mathematical_model} and \ref{cha:design}.
