\section{Springs}
\label{sec_springs}
This section deals with the calculations carried out in order to model the influence of the implemented compliance in terms of energy storage and power requirements minimization.
As explained in \ref{sec:joints}, the selection of the elastic actuators installed and its configuration on RuBi have been left as a customizable feature for research purposes.
This, together with the fact that RuBi has not been designed to optimize a specific type of gait made pointless the calculation of optimal values of springs.
Thus, the following is just a theoretical frame presented to provide an easy method to compute the influence of the springs in the performance once the user has selected them.




%Furthermore, all the studies conducted in the influence of compliance in legged locomotion have been carried out over empirical data recorded for the specific task under analysis.
%All the studies found to optimize the value of springs focus only in a specific velocity and pattern --> we want a wide range of speed and both walk and run
